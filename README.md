# 📌 DashLite – Admin Dashboard UI

DashLite is a modern, admin dashboard UI template built for showcasing eCommerce analytics, product performance, and sales insights.

Key features displayed:

- Sales metrics (Total Earnings, Orders, Customers, Balance)
- Interactive revenue and conversion rate graphs
- Sales analytics by location, age, and gender
- Best selling products and top seller summaries
- Order history and delivery tracking
- Stock and inventory status reports
- Discount product sales trends

⚠️ Note:

- This project is currently optimized for laptop and desktop screen sizes only. Mobile responsiveness is not fully supported.
- This project only includes the dashboard view. Other pages listed in the sidebar (e.g. User Profile, Account, Blog, Pricing, Support Center, etc.) are not included or implemented. This is purely a static front-end UI for the dashboard layout.
